This is a small React App for managing user & roles with interfaces to create, read, update and delete users & roles. Additionally, there is a drag-and-drop interface to map multiple users to roles easily at one go. Currently, the app uses local store (localStorage) to maintain the users & roles created through the frontend interface and the app state is managed by Redux Store. The codebase has reusable components such as BasicForm and BasicTable that renders the respective components based on the configuration object passed to them.
